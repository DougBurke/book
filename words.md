## Introduction

Words are one of the most fundamental building blocks of our language.
Although words may look simple on the surface, they are very ingenious
devices that pack useful information. For our purposes, we will say
that a words consists of a *stem* and *affixes*. Let's look at three simple
sentences:

I **walk**.<br/>
John **walk**s.<br/>
Jack **walk**ed.<br/>

All three sentences contain some 'form' of *walk*. We say that these
instances are all *inflections* of the verb *walk*. The part of the
inflections that is shared (*walk*) is what we call the *stem*. The
parts that are not common are named *affixes*. We inflect verbs
to indicate tense (present, past, etc.), the person of the verb's subject
(first, second, and third person), and the number (singular or plural).

Other types of words have inflections as well. For example, we inflect
nouns to distinguish singular and plural:

I saw one **duck**.<br />
I saw two **duck**s.

Up to this point, we have just seen one kind of affix: one that is
glued to the end of the word. There are actually many kinds of affixes.
For now, you should only know about two:

 * Prefix: appears in front of the stem. For example, *un*believable.
 * Suffix: appears after the stem. For example, duck*s*.

Now, with that out of the way, let's get some work done.
